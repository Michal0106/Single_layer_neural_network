The Académie Française sets an official standard of linguistic purism; however, this standard, which is not mandatory,
is occasionally ignored by the government itself: for instance, the left-wing government of Lionel Jospin pushed for
the feminisation of the names of some functions (madame la ministre) while the Académie pushed for some more traditional
madame le ministre.

Some action has been taken by the government to promote French culture and the French language. For instance, they
have established a system of subsidies and preferential loans for supporting French cinema. The Toubon law, from the
name of the conservative culture minister who promoted it, makes it mandatory to use French in advertisements directed
to the general public. Note that contrary to some misconceptions sometimes found in the Anglophone media, the French
government neither regulates the language used by private parties in commercial settings, nor makes it compulsory that
France-based WWW sites should be in French.
