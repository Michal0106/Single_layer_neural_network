The first written records for the history of France appeared in the Iron Age. What is now France made up the bulk of
the region known to the Romans as Gaul. Greek writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in
the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were Celtic people
speaking what is known as the Gaulish language. Over the course of the first millennium BC the Greeks, Romans and
Carthaginians established colonies on the Mediterranean coast and the offshore islands. The Roman Republic annexed
southern Gaul as the province of Gallia Narbonensis in the late 2nd century BC, and Roman Legions under Julius Caesar
conquered the rest of Gaul in the Gallic Wars of 58â€“51 BC. Afterwards a Gallo-Roman culture emerged and Gaul was
increasingly integrated into the Roman Empire.

In the later stages of the Roman Empire, Gaul was subject to barbarian raids and migration, most importantly by the
Germanic Franks. The Frankish king Clovis I united most of Gaul under his rule in the late 5th century, setting the
stage for Frankish dominance in the region for hundreds of years. Frankish power reached its fullest extent under
Charlemagne. The medieval Kingdom of France emerged from the western part of Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire, known
as West Francia, and achieved increasing prominence under the rule of the House of Capet, founded by Hugh Capet in 987.
